# Machine_Learning_Project-1
Car Price Prediction using ML

Objectives : Built a machine learning model to predict car price.

Steps Involved:
- Imported necessary libraries.
- Loaded the dataset.
- Conducted data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Encoded categorical variables if present.
- Split the data into input and output variables.
- Built two models: Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.
- Evaluated the models.
- Visualized the model output, which could include plots or graphs to represent the results.
